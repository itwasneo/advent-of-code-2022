# advent-of-code-2022
This is my first year attending AOC. At first I was planning committing solutions for 3 different languages each day, but I couldn't stick to the plan. Right now,
I'm only submitting solutions in python, I will try to add solutions for java and rust when I find a chance.

## UPDATE

Since December is approaching, I decided to give one more shot to last years
problems this time, I will only use Rust. You can see my old solutions in the
_archive_ folder.

## Disclaimer
Starting from day 15, my solutions started to get clumsier and clumsier. The problems were also going towards either DFS or BFS solutions each and everyday, so I decided
to cut myself out from this year's advent of code. I won't try to commit daily solutions, but I'm planning to get back to it now and then. These were overall quality
problems.
