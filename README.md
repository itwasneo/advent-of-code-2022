# advent-of-code-2022
This is my first year attending AOC. At first I was planning committing solutions for 3 different languages each day, but I couldn't stick to the plan. Right now,
I'm only submitting solutions in python, I will try to add solutions for java and rust when I find a chance.

## Rust solutions

Inside **rust-solution** directory run

```shell
cargo test tests -- --nocapture
```

## Python solutions

Inside **python-solutions** directory run

```shell
python3 test.py
```

## Java solutions

Inside **java-solutions** directory run

```shell
mvn test
```

## TODO
